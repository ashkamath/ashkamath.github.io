title: Semantic Parsing Survey
permalink: /survey/

Here is a literature survey I had done on the topic of semantic parsing. It is in no way fully complete but I have tried to touch on some of the note worthy papers and transitions in the field over time. You can also [download the PDF here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mrl7w6ghd50dkj0/NLP_Survey_on_Semantic_Parsing__MINE_.pdf?dl=0).
