## Domain Adaptation 

The aim of domain adaptation is to build a classifier such that a classifier that is trained on a domain (source) can be used to predict in a different domain (target). In particular this can apply to the case where there is plenty of labelled training data available in the source domain and scarce (or no) labelled data in the target domain. When this kind of imabalance is prevalent, good generalisation is very important. 

In addition, it is often the case that data is distributed very differently in the source and target domains, which presents a major challenge in being able to adapt predictive models.
