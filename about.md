### Currently ...

Currently, I am working at Oracle Labs, Burlington in the Machine Learning Research group, under <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:bio:0:2069"> Michael Wick </a> and <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:bio:0:304"> Jean-Baptiste Tristan </a> on a digital cervicography project. I am a strong believer in using the knowlegde and tools that we have to address real life issues and working on this project definitely gives me a lot of satisfaction in that respect!

## Professional Timeline

{% include image.html url="/images/mit.jpg" caption="Manipal Institute ofTechnology" width=300 align="right" %}
My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication at Manipal Institute of Technology, India. Here I explored the field of electronics, taking part in competitions and projects, gathering hands-on experience. 



The summer after my sophomore year, I interned under <a href="http://www.aero.iisc.ernet.in/faculty/s-n-omkar"> Dr. S.N. Omkar </a> at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in the Aerospace lab where I worked on building a gesture controlled quadrotor system. This introduced me to several researchers and began my interest in the research life.

In my junior year, a friend and me won an award for a face recognition system that we built for a university wide competition and that ignited my interest in the field of machine learning. I followed that with another internship in the same lab, and worked on extracting rooftop areas from satellite images so as to calculate the solar power potential from the region. This was still done using traditional computer vision approaches and thinking back, would have been so much easier with the common deep learning tools at our disposal now.

I decided at that point to pursue a career in Computer Science and for my undergraduate thesis, tried my hand with deep learning for the first time as I worked on a task of anomaly detection in crowded scenes. My advisor <a href="https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/sanjay-singh.html">Sanjay Singh</a> allayed my fears of switching to a different field for my Master's and I was happy to be accepted at UMass Amherst. 

At UMass, during my first semester, I enjoyed working in  <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mahadeva/Site/About_Me.html">Prof. Sridhar Mahadevan's </a> Lab (Autonomous Learning Laboratory) and explored the area of Domain Adaptation (link here). I also worked on a Visual Question Answering project as part of a Deep Learning course through which I gained experience in using GPUs for computation, working with the Keras framework and in general building deep learning systems. 

In the Spring semester, I worked with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~belanger/">David Belanger</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Prof. Andrew McCallum</a> on the Structured Prediction Networks, and explored the representational capacity of SPENs. Focus was on experiments with toy data with known structure and comparison to the performance of CRFs. Since the framework was originally in Lua, I learnt to work with Lua and Lua based Torch framework. 

I really enjoyed the Artificial Intelligence class I took under Prof. Shlomo Zilberstein and this built an interest in me for planning and decision theory. I will be working on some research ideas that I have, using reinforcement learning and current advances in deep learning when I go back to UMass this fall.


### A little about my past

{% include image.html url="/images/dubai.jpeg" caption="Dubai" width=300 align="right" %}
I was born and partly brought up in Goa, India, a popular tourist destination for many visitors from across the world. Most of my schooling was done in Dubai, UAE where I had the good fortune of meeting people from various places and developed a strong sense of cultural inclusion. I have a passion for languages and like many other 20 somethings, I love to travel and try to explore at any chance that I can get. 


### Hobbies 

I love to play basketball and have been a part of my school and univeristy teams all along till the end of my Bachelors. Sadly however, grad school leaves no time to pursue this now and it is now just for leisure and stress busting!

I also love to paint and here are a few of my favourites.

### Giving back
While at UMass, my advisor from my undergrad asked me to TA for a special audit course on deep learning that he was teaching for the first time this Spring. I happily obliged and was glad to be able to share my experience with my juniors.

I was an active member of the <a href="http://vso.manipal.edu/">Volunteer Services Organisation</a> in Manipal, India and routinely took part in weekly events during which I visited the paediatric ward of the Kasturba Medical Hospital where we organised games and entertained the kids. I also helped conduct events at the home for specially challenged where we would help and teach them to paint.
