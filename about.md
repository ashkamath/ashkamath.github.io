### Currently..
Currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer as part of the Data Science team of the Machine Learning Research Group at Oracle Labs in Burlington, MA. Responsible for working on projects that interact with and optimize Oracle's internal processes and to provide ML solutions to various groups within Oracle. Part of the job also involves research in the field of Natural Language Processing in collaboration the core research team of MLRG.

### Last summer

I worked at Oracle Labs, Burlington in the Machine Learning Research group, under <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:bio:0:2069"> Michael Wick </a> and <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:bio:0:304"> Jean-Baptiste Tristan </a> on a digital cervicography project. 

## Professional Timeline

{% include image.html url="/images/mit.jpg" caption="Manipal Institute ofTechnology" width=300 align="right" %}
My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication at Manipal Institute of Technology, India. These four years gave me experience in working with electronic components, hardware design, embedded systems and fundamentals of computing. Classes like Computer Organization and Architecture, Embedded System Design, Digital Signal Processing, Antenna Design and such introduced me to a wide variety of topics that cover a broad spectrum in the world of electronics. To put some of these learnt skills to practice, in the summer of 2014 I interned at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in the Aerospace lab where I worked on building a gesture controlled quadrotor system. This introduced me to several researchers and established my interest in conducting fundamental research.

Following this, my interest in AI was piqued by a course on Soft Computing Technologies that I took, prompting me to further delve in the area of Machine Learning and AI. Subsequently, a friend and I tried our hand at a face recognition system for a university wide competition and that ignited my interest in the field of machine learning. To continue this interest, I revisited the aerospace lab and worked on extracting rooftop areas from satellite images so as to calculate the solar power potential from the region. Fiddling with computer vision algorithms for segmentation and classification, this stint gave me a feel for the endless applications of this field.

I decided at that point to pursue a career in Computer Science and for my undergraduate thesis, tried my hand with deep learning for the first time as I worked on a task of anomaly detection in crowded scenes. I was advised by <a href="https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/sanjay-singh.html">Sanjay Singh</a> and relied mainly on MOOCs for gathering knowledge of the field as it was still not common knowledge at my university at the time. 

At UMass, during my first semester, I enjoyed working in  <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mahadeva/Site/About_Me.html">Prof. Sridhar Mahadevan's </a> Lab (Autonomous Learning Laboratory) and explored the area of Domain Adaptation <a href="https://ashkamath.github.io/research/Dom_ad/">(link)</a>. Other projects included a Visual Question Answering task <a href="https://ashkamath.github.io/research/vqa/">(link)</a> as part of a Deep Learning course through which I gained experience in using GPUs for computation, working with the Keras framework for building and training deep learning models. 

In the Spring semester, I worked with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~belanger/">David Belanger</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Prof. Andrew McCallum</a> on the Structured Prediction Energy Networks <a href="https://github.com/davidBelanger/SPEN">(link)</a>, and explored the representational capacity of SPENs. Focus was on experiments with toy data with known structure and comparison to the performance of CRFs. Since the framework was originally in Lua, I learnt to work with Lua and Lua based Torch framework. 

The following two semesters flew by in a dizzying flurry of courses and working with Prof. Andrew McCallum on extending the SPEN model to use a novel method for training. Working with Pedram Rooshenas, we developed a training protocol which is able to utilize the vast amounts of unlabelled data we have available to train the model. It uses a rank based training mechanism which is able to train the model using zero labelled instances for a sequence labelling task. We do this by inducing some inductive bias into the model in the form of a "scoring" function that is composed of a small number of human written rules. These rules are able to proagate information and the model is able to generalize and find a consistently better setting out output labels as compared to previous unsupervised (using zero labelled instances) methods. We tried to extend this to other tasks such as semantic parsing and program generation. We also worked on another variant of the SPEN model that involed doing inference in a hidden space. This alleviated the need to project back to the output space for every step of the gradient as was previously necessary. We tried this new method on tasks such an image completion, extreme multi label classification and image denoising. 

### A little about my past

{% include image.html url="/images/goa.jpeg" caption="Goa" width=300 align="right" %}
{% include image.html url="/images/dubai.jpeg" caption="Dubai" width=300 align="right" %}
I was born and partly brought up in Goa, India, a popular tourist destination for many visitors from across the world. Most of my schooling was done in Dubai, UAE where I had the good fortune of meeting people from various places and developed a strong sense of cultural inclusion. I have a passion for languages and like many other 20 somethings, I love to travel and try to explore a new city at any chance that I can get. 


### Giving back
While at UMass, my advisor from my undergrad asked me to TA for a special audit course on deep learning that he was teaching for the first time this Spring. I happily obliged and was glad to be able to share my experience with my juniors.

I was an active member of the <a href="http://vso.manipal.edu/">Volunteer Services Organisation</a> in Manipal, India and routinely took part in weekly events during which I visited the paediatric ward of the Kasturba Medical Hospital where we organised games and entertained the kids. I also helped conduct events at the home for specially challenged where we would help and teach them to paint. 

### Hobbies 

I love to play basketball and have been a part of my school and univeristy teams all along till the end of my Bachelors.

I also love to paint and here are a few of my favourites.
