### Currently ...

Currently, I am working at Oracle Labs, Burlington in the Machine Learning Research group, under <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:bio:0:2069"> Michael Wick </a> and <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:bio:0:304"> Jean-Baptiste Tristan </a> on a digital cervicography project. I am a strong believer in using the knowlegde and tools that we have to adress real life issues and working on this project definitely gives me a lot of satisfaction in that respect!

## Professional Timeline

My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication at Manipal Institute of Technology, India. Here I explored the field of electronics, taking part in competitions and projects, gathering hand-on experience. The summer after my sophomore year, I interned at the Indian Institute of Science, in the Aerospace lab where I worked on building a gesture controlled quadrotor system. This introduced me to several researchers and began my interest in the resarch life. 

In my junior year, a friend and me won an award for a face recognition system that we built for a university wide competition and that ignited my interest in the field of machine learning. I followed that with another internship in the same lab, and worked on extracting rooftop areas from satellite images so as to calculate the solar power potential from the region. This was still done using traditional computer vision approaches and thinking back, would have been so much easier with the common deep learning tools at our disposal now. 

I decided at that point, to pursue a career in Computer Science and for my undergraduate thesis, tried my hand with deep learning for the first time as I worked on a task of anomaly detection in crowded scenes. My advisor <a href="https://manipal.edu/mit/department-faculty/faculty-list/sanjay-singh.html">Sanjay Singh</a> allayed my fears of switching to a different field for my Master's and I was happy to be accepted at UMass Amherst. 

At UMass, during my first semester, I enjoyed working in  <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mahadeva/Site/About_Me.html">Prof. Sridhar's </a> Lab (Autonomous Learning Laboratory) and explored the area of Domain Adaptation (link here). I also worked on a Visual Question Answering project as part of a Deep Learning course through which I gained experience in using GPUs for computation, working with the Keras framework and in general building deep learning systems. 

In the Spring semester, I worked with David Belanger and Prof. Andrew McCallum on the Structured Prediction Networks, and explored the representaional capacity of SPENs. Focus was on experiments with toy data with known structure and comparison to the performance of CRFs. Since the framework was originally in Lua, I learnt to work with Lua and Lua based Torch framework. 

I really enjoyed the Artificial Intelligence class I took under Prof. Shlomo Zilberstein and this built an interest in me for planning and decision theory. I will be working on some research ideas that I have using reinforcement learning and current advances in deep learning when I go back to UMass this fall.

### A little about my past

I was born and partly brought up in Goa, India, a popular tourist destination for many visitors from across the world. Most of my schooling was done in Dubai, UAE where I had the good fortune of meeting people from various places and developed a strong sense of cultural inclusion. I have a passion for languages and like many other 20 somethings, I love to travel and try to explore at any chance that I can get.
