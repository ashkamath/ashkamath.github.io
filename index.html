<h1>About</h1>
{% include image.html url="/images/IMG_9402.jpg" caption="Aishwarya Kamath" width=300 align="center" %}	
<p> I am a PhD student at New York University's Center for Data Science, advised by Prof. Yann LeCun and Prof. Kyunghyun Cho. My research focuses on using information from multiple sources such as text, images, video and speech to improve commonsense reasoning capabilities of machines. Prior to this, I was advised during my Masters by Prof. Andrew McCallum at University of Massachusetts Amherst in areas of natural language processing and machine learning, with a special focus on structured prediction.</p>
<!-- <p> I have also worked as a Machine Learning Engineer as part of the Machine Learning Research Group at Oracle Labs in Burlington, MA.  </p>
<p> When I am not busy doing coursework or research, I love to paint and when time permits, keep my hobby of playing basketball alive. </p> -->
<br>
	<p> If you are a NYU Master's student looking to work on research, especially related to multi-modal learning, feel free to reach out to me! :) </p>
