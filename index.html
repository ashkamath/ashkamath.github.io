<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>I am a second year Master's Student at University of Massachusetts Amherst. My area of focus is mainly Machine Learning and its applications, mainly in the field of Natural Language Processing. I will soon be joining Oracle Labs East as a Member of Technical Staff in the Machine Learning and Computational Scalability Group.    </p>
	<p>My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication and I plan on using the knowledge and tools I have gathered in those four years to tackle interdisciplinary problems. </p>
	<p>When I am not busy doing coursework or research, I love to paint and when time permits, keep my hobby of playing basketball alive. </p>
