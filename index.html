<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>I am a second year Master's Student at University of Massachusetts Amherst. My area of focus is mainly Machine Learning and its applications, mainly in the field of Natural Language Processing. I have been working with Professor Andrew McCallum over the past year on the application of Structured Prediction Energy Networks in a variety of NLP tasks, especially in the context of limited labelled data. I also have a keen interest in applying Machine Learning to solve problems in the medical domain and am currently working at Oracle Labs, East on a digital cervicography task. I have worked on a variety of problems ranging from vision tasks to natural language problems. I wish to work as part of a research group in either industry or academia for a few years and then apply to a phD program.    </p>
	<p>My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication and I plan on using the knowledge and tools I have gathered in those four years to tackle interdisciplinary problems. </p>
	<p>When I am not busy doing coursework or research, I love to paint and when time permits, keep my hobby of playing basketball alive. </p>
