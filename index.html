{% include image.html url="/images/IMG_5090.jpg" caption="Aishwarya Kamath" width=300 align="center" %}	
	<p>I am a second year Master's Student at University of Massachusetts Amherst. My area of focus is mainly Machine Learning and its applications, though my interests cross into the boundaries of Planning and Decision Theory. I also have a keen interest in applying Machine Learning to solve problems in the medical domain and am currently working at Oracle Labs, East on a digital cervicography task. I have worked on a variety of problems ranging from vision tasks to natural language problems and plan to apply t oa phD program in the future.    </p>
	<p>My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication and I plan on using the knowledge and toold I have gathered in those four years to tackle interdisciplinary problems. </p>
	<p>When I am not busy doing coursework or research, I love to paint and when tiem permits, keep my lifelong hobby of playing basketball alive. </p>
