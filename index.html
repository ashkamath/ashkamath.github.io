<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p> I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer as part of the Data Science team of the Machine Learning Research Group at Oracle Labs in Burlington, MA. Responsible for working on projects that interact with and optimize Oracle's internal processes and to provide ML solutions to various groups within Oracle. Part of the job also involves research in the field of Natural Language Processing in collaboration with the core research team of MLRG. </p>
	<p> I completed my Masters at the University of Massachusetts Amherst where I worked in the Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory with Prof. Andrew McCallum. My area of focus is mainly Machine Learning and its applications, primarily in the field of Natural Language Processing.</p>
	<p> My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication and I wish to use the knowledge and tools I have gathered in those four years to tackle interdisciplinary problems. </p>
	<p> When I am not busy doing coursework or research, I love to paint and when time permits, keep my hobby of playing basketball alive. </p>
