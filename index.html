<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p> I am currently working at Oracle Labs East as a Member of Technical Staff in the Machine Learning and Computational Scalability Group.  </p>
	<p> I completed my Masters at the University of Massachusetts Amherst where I worked in the Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory with Prof. Andrew McCallum. My area of focus is mainly Machine Learning and its applications, primarily in the field of Natural Language Processing.   </p>
	<p> My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication and I plan on using the knowledge and tools I have gathered in those four years to tackle interdisciplinary problems. </p>
	<p> When I am not busy doing coursework or research, I love to paint and when time permits, keep my hobby of playing basketball alive. </p>
